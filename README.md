# To-do list
Third project made as a part of YouCode course. It is a simple web application that allows you to add new tasks, remove them and mark as done.

## Usage:
You can type yout task in the input box with "Co jest do zrobienia" placeholder. Next, to add the task - you have to click "Dodaj zadanie" button to make your task appear at the bottom of "Lista zadań". You can delete your task, using the red button on the right side of your task or simply mark it as done, using the green button which is on the left. There are also 2 buttons visible, when there is atleast one task added by you. "Ukryj ukończone" button allows you to hide all tasks that are marked as done, using the previously mentioned green button. "Ukończ wszystkie" button on the other hand marks all tasks as done (as if you clicked the green button on each task simultaneously).
